This README file should be adapted to include the following information:

(1) Which components are part of the infrastructure and how can they be started/configured? Are there any important configuration notes for a local or productive environment?

(2) Are there decisions from the decision log that should be further elaborated? Depending on the level of detail, describe in more detail here or in the wiki.

(3) Are there further links that promote navigation or understanding? For example, link to important decisions in the decision log.

_Note_: The design of the task planning and review is up to the team. One possible option is to use a Kanban board directly via GitHub.
